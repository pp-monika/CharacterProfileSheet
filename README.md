## Character Profile Sheet
Character Profile Sheet is a project for my self-study of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The main webpage is composed mainly of HTML and CSS,
while the rendering of resulting character profile sheet is done using Javascipt.

### Purposes
As a avid lover for creative writing and large worldbuilding, I often have difficulties writing a well thought out characters and keeping track of their background
and development. This sheet is a product of my wish to simplify the process of creating new characters and tracking their stages in life by utilizing the power of
forms and stylings. It acts as a template to flesh out all aspects of the life of fictional characters, from their demographics, physical appearance, history,
to relationship with other characters.

### Scope
This project is in its first stage and therefore will contain a template that is specific to my worldbuilding, such as a drop down menu for affiliations
in the demographics section. However, aside from a few fields in the form, the majority of the form can be applied to creating characters in any universe and world.

### Build status
#### Usable
- Currently able to render a webpage that display the form in a printable format.
#### To-Do
- Style the webpage to look more pleasant to the eyes.
- Style the resulting render of the form to reflect the profile format of the character.
- Implement collapsible menu for each topic in the profile.

### Tech/Framework used
