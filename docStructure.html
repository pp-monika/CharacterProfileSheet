<!--
    A basic template consists of 2 parts:
        1. head
        2. body
    Outside of root HTML, declaring the version of HTML to use via DOCTYPE is a must.

    <head> is useful for visual styling and defining interactivity

        <title> sets the text for the bar tab. There can only be 1 title element.
            * Mandatory
            * Very important to use title that descibe the page because the value within a title is also used in
              a browserâ€™s history system, recorded when the page is bookmarked, and consulted by search engine robots to help determine page meaning.
            * When not specified, browser display the URL path/filename on the bar tab instead.
            * Markup isn't interpreted in a title element, so we cannot format the bar tab with italics and bold, but character entities
              are allowed.

        <meta> specifies MIME type and character set fir displaying languages
            * Is an empty element -> need a trailing / at the end.
            * For standard HTML, the MIME type is always text/html.
            * In the use of XHTML, you may choose from text/html, text/xml, application/xml, and application/xhtml+xml
              as potential MIME types.
            * Used to set arbitrary name-content pairs to provide meta-information about a document for purposes like 
              search engine optimization

        <base> specifies an absolute URL address that is used to provide server and directory information for partially specified URL addresses.
            * Single occurence.

        <link> specifies a special relationship between the current document and another document.
            * Usually used to link a style sheet.

        <object> allows programs and other binary objects to be directly embedded in a Web page.
            * Ex. flash object, Java applets, plug-ins

        <script> allows scripting language code to be either directly embedded within or linked to from a Web page.
            * Can embed an actual JavaScript code into HTML
            * OR can specify the file where the JavaScript is at (preferred)

        <style> encloses document-wide style specifications, typically in Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) format
            * Fonts, colors, positioning, and other aspects of content presentation

        Comment tag is sensitive to dash character and cannot contain another comment tag inside it.

    <body>
        * Only 1 body element can appear per HTML document.
        * block-level elements define structural content blocks such as paragraphs (p) or headings (h1-h6).
            * generally introduce line breaks visually.
            * within a non-empty block, inline elements are found. Ex. bold (b), italic (i), strong (strong), emphasis (em)
            * In a block and in-line element, you may find textual content, including special characters that requires encoding.
                All character codes take the form &code; where code is a word or numeric code indicating the actual character
                    that you want to put onscreen.
            * Types of elements that reference other objects can also be in the block.

The web browser reads the HTML file by building a parse tree to interpret the structure of the document.
    * The structure of the elements and tags can be represented by a tree.
    * Parse tree is often called "DOM" (Document Object Model) tree.
    * JavaScript will also use this parse tree when scripts attempt to manipulate the document

    Example of a parse tree:

        DOCTYPE
            |-- HTML
                  |-- HEAD
                  |     |-- META
                  |     |-- TITLE
                  |     |    |-- "page title"
                  |     |-- <comment>
                  |
                  |-- BODY
                        |-- H1
                        |    |-- "Welcome to the page."
                        |-- HR
                        |-- P
                        |    |-- "HTML"
                        |    |-- EM
                        |    |    |-- "Is not so bad"
                        |    |-- "right?"
                        |-- P
                             |-- "One more paragraph!"

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>  <!-- Root HTML element encloses the entire document. -->

    <head>
        <!-- Head contains info about the page, such as metadata, content, charset,
             and tags describing the document, such as page title -->
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html">
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>(X)HTML Template</title>
        
    </head>


    <body>
        <h1> (X)HTML Template Demo </h1>
        <hr>
        <p> If you want to see the template and example of using tags, see the HTML code for this page. </p>
        <p> This line shows you how <i>italics</i> works inline! </p>
        <p> Oh yeah, there's another way to do italics, but <em>emphasis</em>! The difference is that italics is just text formatting
            while emphasis means you want to emphasize the word! </p>
        <p> You can add special character using the escape character! Like this, &hearts; </p>
        <p> About space, HTML doesn't care if you have soooo many spaces        , it will only show one space. </p>
        <p> You can also <mark style="background-color: blueviolet;">highlight</mark> a text, like in your textbook.</p>
        <p> To make sure both human and non-human can find meaningful representation, use datetime attribute for the non-human: 
            <time datetime="2006-01-13">Friday the 13th</time>. </p>
        <p> It's time we add some picture. </p>

        <figure>
            <dd>
                <img src="tree.jpg" height="160" width="250" alt="It's a magic tree.">
                <p> I use this picture as my home screen. </p>
